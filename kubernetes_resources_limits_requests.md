  ### Number decimal representation
  You can express memory as a plain integer or as a fixed-point number using one of these quantity suffixes: E, P, T, G, M, k. You can also use the power-of-two equivalents: Ei, Pi, Ti, Gi, Mi, Ki
  
  1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization

  400 mebibytes (400Mi)[power of 2 representation] or 400 megabytes (400M)[reqular number representation].
